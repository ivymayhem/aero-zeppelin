        text: 'I''ve decided I will be your Mockingjay, but I have... some conditions. Peeta and the other tributes, Johanna Mason and Annie Cresta, will be rescued at the earliest opportunity. If and when Peeta is liberated, he will receive a full and unconditional pardon, no punishment will be inflicted. And the same goes for the other tributes.'

        text: 'Did you have a nightmare? I have nightmares, too. Someday I''ll explain it to you, why they came, why they won''t ever go away, but I''ll tell you how I survive it. I make a list in my head... of all the good things I''ve seen someone do. Every little thing I can remember. It''s like a game. I do it over and over. Gets a little tedious after all these years, but... there are much worse games to play.'
